# IOPS-2026: IO-Bundle Protocol Standard
**Version:** v1.0.0 · **Status:** `ACTIVE` · **Author:** Yaroslav Vasylenko
**Governs:** All `agent-policy` objects in AgentX Lab

---

## Purpose

IOPS-2026 is the **formal standard** for producing, validating, and releasing
agent-policy objects. It defines the minimum structure, contracts, and evidence
requirements that any object must satisfy before receiving `RELEASE` status.

Think of it as the ISO standard for cognitive system objects.

---

## 1 · Object Structure

Every IOPS-2026-compliant object is an **IO Bundle** — a self-contained unit with:

```
<object-name>/
  IO-BUNDLE.md          # canonical specification (this is the object)
  eval/
    cases/              # test cases (happy, edge, adversarial, long-context)
    run_harness.py      # automated eval runner
    graders.py          # G-RULE graders
  examples/
    happy/              # sample valid inputs + expected outputs
    adversarial/        # attack inputs + expected fail-closed outputs
  artifacts/
    evidence/           # real run evidence (never mock)
  CHANGELOG.md
  MANIFEST.json
```

---

## 2 · Required IO-Bundle Sections

Every IO-BUNDLE.md **must** contain these sections in this order:

```
§1  PRODUCT CARD         — metadata, version, score_target, mode
§2  CONTRACTS            — input, output, policy, change contracts
§3  CORE ARCHITECTURE    — 7 layers: role, objective, constraints,
                           SSOT, algorithm, schema lock, self-check
§4  EVAL PACK            — dataset spec, graders, harness, gates
§5  SECURITY PACK        — attack surface, mitigations, incident runbooks
§6  RELEASE PACK         — release criteria, compatibility matrix, rollback
§7  OPERATIONS PACK      — telemetry, drift signals, incident runbooks
§8  CHANGELOG            — all versions; defects fixed per version
```

Missing any section = schema violation = object cannot be released.

---

## 3 · Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

```
INV-01  Evidence-first:    No claim without reproducible command + output
INV-02  Fail-closed:       Invalid input → structured FAIL object only
INV-03  Determinism:       3 independent runs → identical MERGE_VERDICT
INV-04  Zero UNKNOWN:      UNKNOWN in any gate = FAIL; never silently pass
INV-05  No regression:     Each version ≥ previous version on all gates
INV-06  Secret-clean:      gitleaks PASS on all object output, always
INV-07  Score contract:    Released object score ≥ declared score_target
```

Violating any invariant = object is not IOPS-2026 compliant.

---

## 4 · Scoring Function

```
Score = Σ(w_g × Gate_g)
      + Σ(w_m × MeasuredDelta_m)
      - Σ(w_r × Regression_r)
      - Σ(w_o × Overhead_o)

Gate_g       ∈ {0,1}      binary gate pass/fail
MeasuredDelta_m            measurable improvements over baseline
Regression_r               any degradation vs. previous version
Overhead_o                 unnecessary complexity without ROI

Release threshold: Score ≥ 98
```

---

## 5 · Release Gate Checklist

```yaml
RELEASE_GATE:
  [ ] §1–§8 all present and non-empty
  [ ] INVENTORY_JSON valid (parse test passes)
  [ ] All eval gates DG1–DG7: PASS
  [ ] All release gates G0–G10: PASS or explicitly deferred with justification
  [ ] score ≥ score_target
  [ ] MERGE_VERDICT: YES on 3 independent runs
  [ ] gitleaks: 0 findings on full object text
  [ ] MANIFEST.json generated with real checksums
  [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
```

## 6 · Versioning (SemVer)

| Bump | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| PATCH | Bug fix, doc correction, minor calibration |
| MINOR | New gate, new tool, additive capability |
| MAJOR | Contract change, schema change, security policy change |

MAJOR requires: ADR document + compatibility shim + migration note.

---

## 7 · Eval Harness Requirements

```yaml
model:        pinned (specify in object)
temperature:  0.0
repeats:      3    # all must pass
seed:         42
max_tokens:   ≥32768   # must accommodate full realistic output
```

---

## 8 · Protocol Governance

This protocol is versioned. Breaking changes require MAJOR bump + ADR.
All objects declare which protocol version they comply with.

```yaml
# In every IO-BUNDLE.md PRODUCT CARD:
protocol: IOPS-2026
protocol_version: v1.0.0
```

---

```yaml
# PROTOCOL MANIFEST
name:          IOPS-2026
version:       v1.0.0
status:        ACTIVE
objects_using: [dse-fix-opt v1.1.0]
invariants:    7
release_gates: 11   # G0–G10 + DG1–DG7 eval gates
author:        Yaroslav Vasylenko
