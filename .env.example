# Current auth contract (implemented today):
# - UI sends X-AXL-Api-Key on protected calls (dispatch + forge endpoints)
# - Worker validates this value against AXL_API_KEY secret
#
# TODO(security): VITE_* values are public in the browser bundle; this key is only a client identifier
# and MUST be replaced with real user/service identity (e.g., Cloudflare Access / JWT / mTLS) for production auth.
