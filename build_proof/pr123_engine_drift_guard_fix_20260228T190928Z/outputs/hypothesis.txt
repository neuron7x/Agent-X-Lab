Exit code 2 came from pytest, not compileall: under a controlled reproduction where YAML import is unavailable during test collection, `python -m compileall -q engine` exits with rc=0 because it only byte-compiles source files, while `python -m pytest -q engine/tests` exits with rc=2 and reports collection import errors from `import yaml`; this matches CI finalize output (`gate_rc=2`) and points to missing runtime dependency installation in the gate environment.
