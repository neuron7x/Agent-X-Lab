CATEGORY: CANDIDATE A (outdated required names) but UNPROVEN due missing runtime evidence.
FACTS:
1) ci-supercheck can require analyze/review/scan whenever change-set is not docs-only.
2) Local workflow definitions include jobs with ids analyze/review/scan and no explicit name, so normalized names likely match, but this must be validated against live check-runs.
3) Ground-truth check-runs and rulesets cannot be fetched (HTTP 403 + unknown repo slug), so categories A/B/C/D/E cannot be proven conclusively.
RECOMMENDATION: FAIL-CLOSED. Do not modify CI Supercheck until live check-run samples and ruleset requirements are available.
MISSING DATA:
- Repository slug owner/repo for this checkout.
- GitHub API access to commits/{sha}/check-runs across recent main SHAs.
- GitHub API access to branch protection/rulesets for main.
