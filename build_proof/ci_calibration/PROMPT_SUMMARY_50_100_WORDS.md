This PR calibrates GitHub Actions into a stricter closed-loop test harness by adding missing required checks (Python Verify and Action Pin Audit), pinning action references to full SHAs, hardening workflow shell blocks for deterministic behavior, and synchronizing required-check documentation. It also captures repeatable local evidence under `build_proof/ci_calibration/outputs/` for baseline, workflow inventory, action pin scans, UI loop logs, and Python loop logs. Remaining blockers are explicit: failing engine pytest cases and unavailable authenticated GitHub CLI run-proof capture.
