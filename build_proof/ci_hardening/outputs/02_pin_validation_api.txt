# API validation for repaired action pins (PR #100)

Environment capability:
- gh CLI: unavailable (`command not found`)
- GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN: not set in environment
- Direct api.github.com access: blocked (`CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`)

Attempted validations (required by G1):
1) actions/dependency-review-action
   tag: v4.3.5 (intended from workflow comment)
   commit SHA: 9b1a7f45f3e5d1f839bafb9f2ee58b24dfcf8b2d
   commit API: GET /repos/actions/dependency-review-action/commits/9b1a7f45f3e5d1f839bafb9f2ee58b24dfcf8b2d -> HTTP_STATUS=000 (curl 56, CONNECT tunnel 403)
   tarball API: GET /repos/actions/dependency-review-action/tarball/9b1a7f45f3e5d1f839bafb9f2ee58b24dfcf8b2d -> HTTP_STATUS=000 (curl 56, CONNECT tunnel 403)

2) gitleaks/gitleaks-action
   tag: v2.3.6 (intended from workflow comment)
   commit SHA: b0f320ce5e5370a97f4cde6f0f08f442a5f2e0d1
   commit API: NOT EXECUTED (same network/auth blocker)
   tarball API: NOT EXECUTED (same network/auth blocker)

3) reviewdog/action-actionlint
   tag: v1.58.0 (intended from workflow comment)
   commit SHA: c5f8846e0cf154140a390f389ec69a56495bb8de
   commit API: NOT EXECUTED (same network/auth blocker)
   tarball API: NOT EXECUTED (same network/auth blocker)

Result:
- G1 cannot be satisfied in this environment (no 200 commit proof and no 302/200 tarball proof reachable).
