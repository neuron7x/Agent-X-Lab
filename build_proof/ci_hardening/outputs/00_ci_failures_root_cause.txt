# Root-cause record (PR #100) — supersedes earlier capture

## Verified mechanical root causes fixed in this patch
1) Unpinned workflow actions remained in `ui-perf.yml` (`actions/setup-node@v4` in two jobs), violating CHK-CI-G3.
2) Workflow Hygiene check publication needed explicit `pull-requests: read` in addition to `checks: write` and `contents: read` for `github-pr-check` reporter least-privilege clarity.

## Evidence of applied fixes
- `ui-perf.yml` now pins both setup-node steps to `60edb5dd545a775178f52524783378180af0d1f8`.
- `workflow-hygiene.yml` permissions now: `contents: read`, `checks: write`, `pull-requests: read`.
- Pin audit now reports zero `NOT_PINNED` lines.

## Verification blockers (cannot prove CI green from this environment)
- `gh` CLI unavailable (`command not found`).
- GitHub API run query blocked (`CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`).

## Minimal operator runbook to unblock G6
1. `gh run list --repo neuron7x/Agent-X-Lab --branch <pr-branch> --limit 20`
2. `gh run rerun <run-id>` (or push noop commit)
3. `gh run watch <run-id>`
4. `gh run view <run-id> --json jobs,conclusion,url`
5. `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed > build_proof/ci_hardening/outputs/17_ci_failed_logs_excerpt.txt`
6. Update `build_proof/ci_hardening/ci_links.txt` with run+job URLs and set checklist items to PASS only for proven green checks.
