# Root-cause capture for initial failing PR checks (PR #100)

## Decisive failure classes (from PR UI + inline review comments)
1) CodeQL jobs (`codeql (javascript-typescript)`, `codeql (python)`): invalid `github/codeql-action` pin caused action resolution failure (`Can't find 'action.yml'` / 404 class).
2) Workflow Hygiene (`actionlint`): reviewdog check publication failed with `Resource not accessible by integration` class due missing `checks: write` permission.

## Implemented fixes in this patch
- Re-pinned `github/codeql-action/{init,analyze,upload-sarif}` to `89a39a4e59826350b863aa6b6252a07ad50cf83e` (`v4.32.4`).
- Added `checks: write` to Workflow Hygiene job permissions while keeping least privilege.
- Completed remaining workflow SHA pinning across repository workflows in scope.

## Verification blocker in this execution environment
- `gh` CLI unavailable (`command not found`).
- Direct access to github.com Actions job page returns `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`.

## Commands proving blocker
- `gh --version` => EXIT_CODE=127
- `curl -L --max-time 20 -sS https://github.com/neuron7x/Agent-X-Lab/actions/runs/22500920063/job/65187507908?pr=97` => EXIT_CODE=56

## Additional fail-closed blocker found during pin audit
- `ui-perf.yml` still contains `actions/setup-node@v4` in two jobs.
- These refs are outside this task's explicit allowed edit list, so CHK-CI-G3 cannot be promoted to PASS without scope expansion.
