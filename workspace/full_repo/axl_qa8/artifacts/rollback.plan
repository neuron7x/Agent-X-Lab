# AXL — Rollback Plan (Fail-Closed)

## Rollback triggers (any => rollback)

- Any HARD gate fails post-deploy (G0/G1/G2/G3/G4/G5/G6/G7/G11).
- Any evidence-chain integrity anomaly.
- Unauthorized access suspicion.
- Sustained 5xx > 2 minutes.

## Rollback steps

### 1) UI (Vercel)

1. Roll back to previous Vercel deployment (last known good).
2. Verify UI loads and can query `/healthz` and `/vr` via BFF.

### 2) Worker (Cloudflare)

1. Deploy the last known good Worker version (pinned tag or previous deploy).
2. Confirm:
   - `/healthz` is OK
   - `/vr` returns expected
   - Protected endpoints reject requests without key

### 3) GitHub workflows / dispatch

1. Disable `repository_dispatch` triggers if they amplify incident.
2. Confirm no automation continues to write PB/VR during incident.

## Evidence retention

- Save logs + artifacts before rollback when possible.
- Record UTC times + version identifiers.
