Subject: Endorsement Request — The Dopaminergic Arbiter Hypothesis (Vasylenko, 2026)

Hello,

I am an independent researcher from Ukraine working at the intersection of neuroscience and AI alignment. I have formalized a model (DAO) where the human dopaminergic system acts as an external arbiter for loop-closure in iterative optimization.

I am seeking an endorsement for an arXiv submission in the cs.AI category. The work connects loop-termination invariants to (i) control theory constraints, (ii) Gödel-style limitations on self-verification, and (iii) predictive-processing / Free Energy framing.

Preprint (PDF): `Vasylenko_DAO_Arbiter_2026.pdf` (repository root)
Repository: public GitHub repository `dao-arbiter`

If you are willing to endorse, I will send the arXiv submission identifier immediately after upload.

Thank you for considering,
Vasylenko Yaroslav
