# Error Codes

## Documented deterministic errors

- `E_BACKEND_TORCH_MISSING`: accelerated backend was requested without torch availability.
- `E_NO_GIT_NO_BUILD_ID`: provenance fallback requested without both git commit and BUILD_ID.

README links to this file as the SSOT for user-facing deterministic error codes.
